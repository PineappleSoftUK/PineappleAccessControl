# Pineapple Access Control

Description
------------

A relatively self-contained and basic PHP-based member system to restrict certain pages on a website to those who log-in, with user accounts issued by a superuser. Please see the GitHub Wiki for more.


Important Information
---------------------

I am an amateur developer, this is software written by me as practice and is not guaranteed to be error free, however it may be of use as a starting point for your own project and/or adapted to suit your own needs.

The files need to be hosted on a webserver running php. On the initial visit to index.php a sqlite database will be created, please ensure you have the correct directory/folder permissions to allow this to happen, an example htaccess file is included to prevent the database file from being downloaded by a third party.
